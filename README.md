# Smart Chessboard - Micropython

## Introduction

This is a micropython project for the ESP32. It is a chessboard with a sensors that sense the position of the pieces. It is an embedded system project.

It uses API endpoints to communicate with the server, sending the position of the pieces and receiving the moves to be made. The moves are generated by stockfish, a chess engine. 

## Hardware

- ESP32
- PCB boards
  - [Controller](https://github.com/shuki25/smart-chessboard-controller)
  - [Chess clock](https://github.com/shuki25/smart-chessboard-clock)
  - [Chessboard](https://github.com/shuki25/smart-chessboard-board)

## Software

- Micropython
- Stockfish
- API endpoints

## Python dependencies
Install the following python dependencies necessary to upload the code to the ESP32:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installing Micropython on ESP32

- Download the latest version of nightly builds Micropython firmware (fixes a particular bug that the chess program depends on) from [here](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/).
- Download the latest version of esptool from [here](https://github.com/espressif/esptool)

Program your board using the esptool.py program, found here.

If you are putting MicroPython on ESP32 for the first time then you would first erase the entire flash using:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.usbserial-0001 erase_flash
```

From then on program the firmware starting at address 0x1000:
```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.usbserial-0001 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 <es>.bin
```

## Bytecode compilation
Due to large size of the chess program, it is necessary to compile them  into bytecode and stored in the `bytecode-complied` folder. To compile the scripts, run:
```bash
mpy-cross-v6 *.py
mv *.mpy bytecode-compiled/
```

## Installing this project

- Clone this repository to your computer
- Install Thonny IDE
- Copy the files in the `bytecode-compiled` folder to the ESP32 board
- Connect your ESP32 to WiFi to be able to install the dependencies
- Install dependecies using `mip` after dropping into the `micropython` interactive shell (REPL)

```ipython
>>> import network
>>> sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
>>> sta_if.active(True)
>>> sta_if.connect('your-ssid', 'your-password')
>>> sta_if.isconnected()
>>> import mip
>>> mip.install("ssd1306")
```
